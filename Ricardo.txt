-A PDE that's "the limiting behaviour" of the Braum Willet
-Compare the solutions of the full PDE to the solutions where we just pick just one direction
-Is there something in between those cases? ( how to modify the PDE? or something in a organized manner)

3/4/22 meeting
-Focus on the one dimensional case and figure out the restrains issue 
	*too many/few constants and fix number of restrains
	*how does the flux equations gets involved 
-Make R=0 so that no mass is leaving the system
-start typing down some numerical solution to the one dimensional case to see the
 convergence from the transient state into the steady state

	
4/1/22 meeting
-Laguerre polynomial and Laplace transform
https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00098062v4/document
-Take a look at the generalized Laguerre
-Try to follow the paper and use the Flux functions they are using

4/11/22
-We need an example we can verify the solution to compare or reproduce an example from the paper
