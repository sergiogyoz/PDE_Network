For the example problem we have the following setup
	- the number of transporters per unit length is 
	proportional to the radius of the vessel
	- the number of transporters per unit volume of blood 
	is inversely proportional to the radius of the vessel
	- the local delivery rate per unit of resource Rij 
	is inversely proportional to the radius of the vessel
	- We fix the concentration at node 1
	- inject some volume of fluid F per unit time at node 1,
	and remove an equal volume of fluid at node 2
	- conductance of each edge is proportional to  S_i^2/l_ij.

Stuff I'm assuming/guessing from the info
	- F is the medium volume moving through (constant)
	- F = Si*uij
